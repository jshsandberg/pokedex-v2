# Pokedex Version 2.0

A more sophsitacted Pokedex that incorporates a cleaner UI and cleaner code. Having a better understanding on hooks and lifecycles for React, I wanted to go back and work on some projects that I worked on before and see how much I have really grown. Currently, this Pokedex only shows the Galar region; however, I have made the code dry enough that it could be used for all regions. Taking a break from it now, but want to complete the whole Pokedex in the future. This also gives me some work and understanding when it comes to CSS, a frustrating aspect of this project.
